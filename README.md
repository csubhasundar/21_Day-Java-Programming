# What is Java?

## Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.

Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.

# Parameters used in First Java Program
## class keyword is used to declare a class in Java.

## public keyword is an access modifier that represents visibility. It means it is visible to all.

## static is a keyword. If we declare any method as static, it is known as the static method. The core advantage of the static method is that there is no need to create an object to invoke the static method. The main() method is executed by the JVM, so it doesn't require creating an object to invoke the main() method. So, it saves memory.

## void is the return type of the method. It means it doesn't return any value.

## main represents the starting point of the program.

## String[] args or String args[] is used for command line argument. We will discuss it in coming section.

## System.out.println() is used to print statement. Here, System is a class, out is an object of the PrintStream class, println() is a method of the PrintStream class. We will discuss the internal working of System.out.println() statement in the coming section
